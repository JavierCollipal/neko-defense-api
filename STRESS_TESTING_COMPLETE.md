## 💡 KEY LEARNINGS

1. **Multi-Tool Strategy**: Using three tools provides comprehensive coverage
   - autocannon for speed
   - Artillery for realism
   - k6 for depth

2. **Rate Limiting**: High "error" rates are expected when testing rate limits - this validates protection is working!

3. **Heavy Queries**: Database-intensive endpoints need lower concurrency targets (20-50 vs 100+)

4. **Soak Tests**: Critical for production - detect issues that short tests miss

5. **Custom Metrics**: Neko Mode and Kawaii Level make results more engaging and memorable

6. **Breaking Point Tests**: Allow higher error rates (20-30%) to find true system limits

7. **JSON Export**: Enables trend analysis and regression detection over time
